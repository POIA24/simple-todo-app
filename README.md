## This is a fully functionality todo app with local storage

I use React.js, Recoil, Material-UI, FlipMove, uuid and Circular-progressbar

### `Recoil`

I coded every single line about recoil with a comments so than you can understand better what is it and how it works

### `Material-UI`

Material-UI for the icon

### `FlipMove`

FlipMove for the fancy animation

### `uuid`

uuid for unique id of each todo

### `Circular-progressbar`

Circular-progressbar for the percentage progressbar
